DUToolkit

The DUToolkit package provides a suite of tools and visualization for
the characterization, estimation, and communication of parameter
uncertainty and decision risk. The package is designed to evaluate the
impact of policy alternatives on outcomes compared to baseline (i.e.,
counterfactual analysis), leveraging model outputs from uncertainty
analysis.

During public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
decision-makers relied on models to predict and estimate the impact of
various policy alternatives on health outcomes. Often, there is a high
degree of uncertainty in the evidence base underpinning these models.
When there is increased uncertainty, the risk of selecting a policy
option that does not align with the intended policy objective also
increases; we term this decision risk. Even when models adequately
capture uncertainty, the tools used to communicate their outcomes,
underlying uncertainty, and the associated decision risk are important
to mitigate decisions to adopt sub-optimal policies and/or critical
health technologies.

## Installation

You can install the ‘DUToolkit’ package from CRAN with the following
command in the console:

    #> Installing package into 'C:/Users/mwiggins/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpQvV8Ba/temp_libpath404c71cf3415'
    #> (as 'lib' is unspecified)
    #> Warning: package 'DUToolkit' is not available for this version of R
    #> 
    #> A version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere,
    #> see the ideas at
    #> https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-packages
